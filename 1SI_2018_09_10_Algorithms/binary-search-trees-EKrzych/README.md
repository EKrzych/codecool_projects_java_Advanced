# Binary Search Trees

Requirements:

- Given an array sorted in increasing order with unique integer elements write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height. Hint: The middle element of the array should be the root.
- Write a function to find if an element is in the tree or not.
- Write functions to add and remove elements from the tree. Its OK if the tree will not have a minimal depth after calling these. Also remove can be implemented by removing the element and all it's children but you may think about the possibility to make a version of remove what only removes the requested node and re-orders it's descendants.
