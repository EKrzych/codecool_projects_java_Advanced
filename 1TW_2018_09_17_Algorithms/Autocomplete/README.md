# Tries Assignment: Implement an autocomplete app using Tries

Your tasks implement to following:

- Add code that imeplements such Trie data structure
- Implement a function called addWord(String wordToAdd) that allows you to add words to your Trie.
- Load and add all the words from the wordList.txt thats in the repo.
- Implement a function wit the signature List autoComplete(String wordBase). maxResults denotes how many results to return. If there are too many return the first ones in alphabetical order. For example if the input is "spectrog" it should return "spectrogram, spectrograph, spectrographic, spectrographically". Optional: Limit the number of results returned to 10.
- (optional) Implement a function called boolean removeWord(String wordToRemove) : This function removes the given word from your Trie. It should return true if the removal was successful, false if the word was not in the trie.
